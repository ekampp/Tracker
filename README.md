# Tracker

An extremely light weight API for tracking objects in 3D space and time. This can be used for something like arrowspace tracking and collision prediction.

## Getting started

First off, to get started you need to [acquire a username and a password](http://track.wiki/register). The entire API is protected by http basic authentication.

After this, first step is something like

    curl --user "caspyin:PASSWD" https://api.github.com/gists/starred

For further information on how to interact with the API in detail, see [the documentation](http://track.wiki/documentation)
